# Flask: This is the main class from the Flask web framework used to create the web application.
# request: A module from Flask that allows access to request data such as query parameters, form data, etc.
# jsonify: A function from Flask to convert Python dictionaries to JSON responses.
# RateLimiter: This is a custom class imported from rate_limiter_2.py which presumably contains the logic for rate limiting.
# time: Imported but not used in this snippet. It might be used in the RateLimiter class or could be intended for other functionalities such as delays.

# Flask Application Initialization: Creates an instance of the Flask web application. 
# __name__ is a special Python variable that represents the name of the module. 
# Flask uses this to know where to look for resources.

# Rate Limiter Initialization: Creates an instance of the RateLimiter class. 
# This object will be used to check whether a userâ€™s requests are within the allowed limits.

# When a request is made to this endpoint, the resource function is called.

    # Rate Limiting Check:
    # Calls the is_allowed method of the RateLimiter instance, passing the user_id. This method checks if the user has exceeded their request limit and returns a tuple (allowed, retry_after):
    #     allowed: A boolean indicating if the request is allowed or not.
    #     retry_after: A string or integer indicating how many seconds the client should wait before making another request if the rate limit has been exceeded.

    #     Creates a JSON response with a message indicating the rate limit has been exceeded ("Rate limit exceeded").
    #     Sets the HTTP status code to 429 to indicate the rate limit error.
    #     Adds a Retry-After header to the response, specifying how long the client should wait before making another request. This header value is obtained from the retry_after variable returned by the is_allowed method.
    #     Returns the response.

# Starting the Server: Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module in another script). 
# If so, it starts the Flask development server on port 5000.
